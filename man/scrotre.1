SPECIAL STRINGS
Both the \fB\-\-exec\fR and filename parameters can take format specifiers
that are expanded by scrotre when encountered.
.IP
There are two types of format specifier. Characters preceded by a '%'
are interpreted by strftime(2). See man strftime for examples.
These options may be used to refer to the current date and time.
.IP
The second kind are internal to scrotre and are prefixed by '$'
The following specifiers are recognised:
.IP
$f image path/filename (ignored when used in the filename)
$u uuid
$w image width
$h image height
.IP
Example:
.IP
scrotre '%Y\-%m\-%d\-%H%M%S_$wx$h_scrotre.png'
Creates a file called something like 2013\-06\-17\-082335_263x738_scrotre.png
